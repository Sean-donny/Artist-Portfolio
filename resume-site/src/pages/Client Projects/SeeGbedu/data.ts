      'I saw this photo of Len on his Instagram, where he put on this distinct outfit, likely for a phot/video shoot of some sorts. The outift struck me and I added it to my inspo folder. I am always on the hunt for new references to draw/study from when I need to cook, and this one made its way into a drawing session right after completing some client projects.',

    paragraph: `I was experimenting with new ideas and motifs. The Skulls—a set of recognizable symbols to identify my work—were meant to make it clear it was mine, even without seeing my name.\n
I'm a fan of Len, and I knew he was in his 'Goldenboy' era, as seen in his hashtags and social media. So I designed this poster with a propaganda theme—something that looked like a political flyer you'd see plastered on walls.\n
It didn’t end up in the Instagram Art Dump, but I did post it on Twitter. He saw it—and liked it.`,

      'Len sent this over on iMessage explaining the layout for me. He said he loved the artwork as is and only wanted to add the typography where he stated. A rare experience, clients usually have a thing or two (or a thousand) to change, but he was super straightforward to work with.',

    title: 'See Gbedu Single Cover',
    year: '(2025)',
    header: 'Single Cover',
    paragraph: `After adjusting the alignment and experimenting with cropping, the final piece of the puzzle was choosing the right font. I had used a great one in the poster, but when it comes to commercial work, I’ve learned the importance of using fonts you’re legally allowed to—whether that means purchasing a license or selecting a commercially approved alternative.\n
This ended up being the fastest cover I’ve ever completed. Aside from the time spent on the original illustration, it took just three hours of exchanging options over iMessage before we landed on the final version.
\nIt was definitely one for the books—creative, efficient, and rewarding. I even took the opportunity to explore a visualiser as a personal experiment. Overall, a great experience!`,
