      'I hopped in the studio and came up with a rough sketch for O. It is crucial to always closely communicate with the client, especially in the early stages of the project; that way, we know the project is heading in the right direction. After a brief conversation, it became clear that the desired outcome was not just a one-to-one stylisation of the music video, but an artistic interpretation.',

      "After changing my approach to the illustration, I shared this version with O. Judging by how the final version came out, it is safe to say he loved it. I made sure to incorporate a sine wave-like signature into the general shape language to complement the groovy nature of the song. Additionally, I exaggerated the curves in the girls' poses to ensure their silhouettes stood out boldly, both individually and within the composition as a whole, while also maintaining a certain degree of anatomical correctness.",

The characters stand boldly and brightly against a stark black background. Purple was chosen to symbolise royalty, aligning with the term "crown" and its associated symbolism. This iteration also led to the creation of an animated YouTube visualizer, adapted into a Spotify canvas, and a promotional TikTok video.',
