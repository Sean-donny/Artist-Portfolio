The client's request for a promotional video featuring motion animations of the artists, to accompany a snippet of the single which will be shared on social media, necessitates a believable setting. Typically, rendering the entire background of an illustration isn't required, especially when it might be obstructed by the subject, as that level of detail may not translate to the final product. However, given the dynamic nature of motion graphics with numerous moving parts, it's essential to establish a well-defined background, such as this backyard pool, for the characters to seamlessly navigate.",
