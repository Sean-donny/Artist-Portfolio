He usually works with “The Usual Suspects” — Bidemitata and FallofMichael — so my involvement was a first of its kind. We started by creating a cover for a single called 100 Bricks, though it was eventually scrapped. From there, we moved on to other projects.`,

    paragraph: `YP asked me to hop on the official cover for his Independence Day release, National Anthem, and I got straight to work.\n\nThe cover shows him in a big pink fur jacket, a Kaws Friends tee, CG headwear, and of course, his YPSZN chain — cold. I placed him against a trippy green-and-white background to reflect the Nigerian Independence theme, with four CG smileys pinned in each corner — I had just designed those logos for Muhktar earlier that year.\n\nYP then brought in FallofMichael to add the finishing touches: a fresh plastic wrap overlay and a title card at the bottom right, which tied perfectly into the trippy vibe. The result was an amazing cover, created through real collaboration and rooted in our shared history — one of my proudest achievements.`,
